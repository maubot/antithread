# antithread
A simple [maubot](https://github.com/maubot/maubot) that redacts all thread messages.

A public instance is available at [@antithread:maunium.net]. Simply invite it
to your room, give it moderator permission (or whatever is necessary to redact
messages), and it will delete new thread messages as they're sent.
